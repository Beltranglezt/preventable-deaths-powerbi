# Preventable Deaths Dashboard (Power BI)

This project explores preventable deaths worldwide and in Europe between 1990 and 2017.  
It focuses on lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors using data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).

## Key Insights
- **Most preventable deaths today are driven by lifestyle and cardiovascular risks, not infections.**
- High systolic blood pressure, smoking, and high fasting plasma glucose are the leading global contributors.
- Interactive filters allow comparisons across European countries and different years.

## Dashboard Content

- **Horizontal Bar Chart (2017):** Mortality distribution by risk factor worldwide.  
- **Column Chart (Europe):** Compare preventable deaths by european country, filterable by year and risk factor.  
- **Line Chart (1990â€“2017):** Trends in the main preventable risk factors worldwide.
